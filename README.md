# Karate Runner

This extension will enable you to run/debug Karate Tests and open Build Reports from Codelens and Activity Bar.

A Codelens will be added above each `Feature:`, `Scenario:` and `Scenario Outline:` keyword within each Karate feature file.  Clicking on the Codelens for a Feature test will run all Scenario and Scenario Outlines within the target feature file.  Clicking on the Codelens for a Scenario or Scenario Outline test will run only that Scenario or Scenario Outline.

A Karate Activity Bar will be added to VSCode.  Clicking on the Activity Bar will reveal a `Build Reports` and a `Tests` view.  Clicking on a report will open it within the default program defined for its file type.  Clicking on a Feature test will run all Scenario and Scenario Outlines within the target feature file.  Clicking on a Scenario or Scenario Outline test will run only that Scenario or Scenario Outline.

*Note: Karate Features and Scenarios marked with exclusions such as `@KarateOptions(tags = {"~@ignore"})` will not be run.*


## General Setup
Please make sure you are using `VSCode Version 1.36.0` or greater. (Required)

Please make sure you are using `Karate Version 0.9.3` or greater in your Karate projects. (Required)

Goto the following path to configure this extension `Preferences > Settings > Search for Karate Runner`.

## Debug Setup
Please make sure you are using `Karate Version 0.9.5` or greater in your Karate projects.  (Required to enable debug mode)

*Note the following steps are subject to change as VSCode and other tools evolve.*

#### Setup VSCode
- Click `Debug` icon in Activity Bar to open debugger.
- Click `Gear/Cog` icon at the top and click `Karate (debug)` to open launch.json.
- Click `Add Configuration` button to add debug configurations as needed.
  - Click `Karate (debug): Gradle` to add Gradle debug.
  - Click `Karate (debug): Maven` to add Maven debug.
- Edit debug configurations as needed.
  - Note `feature` property is used to find project root if multiple projects are loaded in IDE.  Additionally used by Karate Debug Server if `karateOptions` property not specified.  Recommend default setting which finds feature files opened in IDE.
  - Note `karateOptions` is used only by Karate Debug Server.  Overrides `feature` property to enable advanced debugging and specifying all Karate Options(classpath, threads, tags).
 - Next to `Gear/Cog` icon expand dropdown and select debug configuration to use.

#### Setup Gradle (If applicable)
- Open build.gradle for target project.
- Add the following task to build.gradle.
    ```java
    task karateExecute(type: JavaExec) {
        classpath = sourceSets.test.runtimeClasspath
        main = System.properties.getProperty('mainClass')
    }
    ```

#### Debug Project
- Set breakpoint(s) within feature file(s).
- Keep feature file(s) opened in editor. (Recommended)
- Start debugging.

## Release Notes
0.5.0 - Remove reliance on feature files having to be `in focus` within IDE to start debugging.  See `Debug Setup` section for details.  **Note new debug configurations will need to be setup in launch.json.**  Add `Smart Paste` to detect when pasting into feature files via keyboard shortcut(eg Cmd+V).  Add `curl` detection to `Smart Paste` to transform curl commands into Karate syntax.  Add option to `Fold` or minimize each `Scenario:` or `Scenario Outline:`.

0.4.1 - Add option to specify switches when debugging within `feature` property of `launch.json`.

0.4.0 - Add option to debug feature files.  This feature requires `Karate Version 0.9.5`.  For Gradle users ensure you have setup a `karateExecute` task in `build.gradle` as defined above in the `Setup Gradle` steps.

0.3.3 - Remove `classpath:` from command when referencing fully qualified path to test(s).

0.3.2 - Resolve [task execution issue](https://github.com/kirksl/karate-runner/issues/3) introduced in vscode 1.37 with workaround.

0.3.1 - Add option to specify entire karate.jar(Standalone) command in settings.

0.3.0 - Remove reliance on tests having to exist under `src/test/java` especially for karate.jar(Standalone).  Downstream this will simplify setting the property `Karate Runner > Tests: To Target` to something like `**/*.feature`.  Add `Run All Tests` action for every folder node that is an ancestor of a *.feature file within Activity Bar Tests view.  This will enable running all tests that are scoped below target folders and in scope based on the setting `Karate Runner > Tests: To Target`.

0.2.0 - Add `Open In Editor` action for *.feature file nodes within Activity Bar Tests view.  Add `Collapse All` action to Build Reports and Tests views within Activity Bar.  Add support for Standalone execution mode via karate.jar.  Please note the first karate.jar(Standalone), pom.xml(Maven) or build.gradle(Gradle) found **in that order** when traversing backwards from the *.feature file will be used for execution.  This will also constitute your project root directory.

0.1.3 - Hide tests that are commented from Codelens and Activity Bar.  Remember last Karate Runner when using `Prompt To Specify` Karate Runner popup.

0.1.2 - Connect to Github Repo.

0.1.1 - Resolve project dependencies missing when publishing.

0.1.0 - Add support for Gradle and Maven.  Please note the first pom.xml(Maven) or build.gradle(Gradle) found when traversing backwards from the *.feature file being tested will be used to run all Maven and Gradle commands.  This will also constitute your project root directory.  Add support to automatically open any file(s) once tests finish running.  For example you may want specific html reports to automatically load into a browser.  Add a Karate Activity Bar to VSCode to enable management of build reports and tests in a central location.

0.0.3 - Remove requirement to specify a regular expression to determine where to show a Codelens.  A Codelens will now be shown above every `Feature:` and `Scenario:`.

0.0.2 - Remove requirement for terminal to be set to the pom.xml directory prior to clicking on a Codelens.  We now traverse backwards from feature file until a pom.xml is found and call Maven with it.

0.0.1 - Initial release.
